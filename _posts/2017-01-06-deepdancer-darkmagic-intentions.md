deepdancer-darkmagic is an extension to deepdancer it's adding some features
that many would call magic.

Since magic is often seen as a bad / dangerous thing in software engineering,
we keep it aside from deepdancer. deepdancer-darkmagic is fully compatible with
deepdancer it is just adding features.

In a few words: deepdancer-darkmagic here is to prevent you from declaring
manually the `__dependencies` attribute of your module infering them from
parameters names.
